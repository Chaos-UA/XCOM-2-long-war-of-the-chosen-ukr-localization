Commander's Choice lets you set the class of any Rookie who is ready to rank up to Squaddie.

A button has been added on the Armory Soldier Main Menu. By Default Commander's Choice replaces the Promotion button for Rookies in the Armory (screenshot 1), and disables the Promotion Button for Rookies on the After Action screen (screenshot 3). This behavior can be customized in the ini.

Options:
-Hide the Promote Button for Rookies on the Armory Screen?			 	Default: True
-Hide the Promote Button for Rookies on the After Action Screen?	 	Default: False
-Disable the Promote Button for Rookies on the After Action Screen? 	Default: True


The Commander's Choice button will only appear for Rookies when have earned but not yet recieved a promotion.

Fully Compatabile with Long War 2!

WARNING: If you promote a Rookie from the After Action screen instead of the Armory Commander's Choice will be bypassed. This is why the Button is disabled by Default for Rookies.

The UI has a few niggles:
-You may have to click twice on a the Selected class
-The Time of 0 Days is an artifact of the type of menu, I can't hide it (or haven't figured out how)
-There is no Cancel/Back button (can't figure this one out), use the Esc key or choose the class that the soldier already is (this aborts the operation)
-The tooltip for Commander's Choice might be the Dismiss tooltip, do not worry it won't Dismiss your soldier.
-The Commander's Choice button does not work with Controllers at this time.

The PsiOps and Spark classes cannot be changed to or from, for lore and mechanical reasons. The button will not appear for these classes. Any other class, including custom classes (as shown in the screenshot), can be changed to and from. 


This mod has no class overrides and should be compatible with most mods.
